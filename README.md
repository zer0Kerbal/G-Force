What is G-Force?
================

G-Force is a mod for KSP that introduces the effects of G-forces to the player, visual effects such as redouts, blackouts and FOV changes are simulated within the players camera view.


G-Force - Development Thread

Version 0.0.4-alpha released 1/29/2015

G-Force is a plugin that aims to represent the effects of G-forces on your kerbals by applying visual effects, such as blackouts and redouts, to the flight camera. With the mod currently in alpha stage this thread aims to reach out to the KSP community for help and direction with it's development. This mod currently targets 9G's as a maximum limit, at which vision is completely obscured.

What can I do to help?

I'm looking for all and any feedback that anyone is kind (and constructive!) enough to give, but especially with focus on the following:

    Accuracy of the g-force effects in relation to the g-force meter in KSP.
    Realism of the g-force effects, I've only been able to go off of wiki and other web information but anyone who has real world experience would be super helpful!

Planned features

    The effects are currently limited to applying either a black or red filter to the screen at varying levels of transparency, as this mod is developed I would like to improve on this with, for example, effects being more focused on restricting the field of view as the g-forces increase instead of just redding or blacking out the whole screen.
    Currently the effects will apply to all vessels, however, this should be restricted to manned vessels and not show the g-forces when piloting probes.
    Implement a GUI with options for toggling the G effects on and off and restricting them to IVA only.
    Delay startup of G effects until after the vessel is fully loaded.
    Tie G tolerance into the Kerbal professions and XP system.

Features implemented but still WIP

    Make G effects cumulative based upon time spent at a particular G, allowing for tolerance of G forces over certain periods of time.
    Implement negative G's.
    Reduce tolerance to negative G's.

Completed features

None as of yet!

I'm up for this! Where can I get the alpha?
